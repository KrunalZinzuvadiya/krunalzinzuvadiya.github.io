Introduction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. The dataset used includes key health factors such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more. This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, using libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The aim is to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals, leading to early intervention and treatment.

Data Preparation:
The dataset was cleaned, and missing values were handled to ensure accurate model training. Key features like blood pressure, insulin levels, and age were used for prediction.

Model Development:
Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to identify the best performing model. The performance of each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
