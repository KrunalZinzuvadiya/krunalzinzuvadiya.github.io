Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to solve the classic Frozen Lake problem. The Frozen Lake environment, part of OpenAI's Gym toolkit, requires an agent to navigate across a grid of frozen surfaces without falling into holes, while reaching a goal. This project showcases expertise in developing RL agents, utilizing algorithms like Q-learning and Value Iteration to find optimal strategies for navigating the frozen terrain safely.

Project Preview

Environment:
The Frozen Lake environment is modeled as an 8x8 grid where each tile can either be frozen or a hole. The agent starts at a defined position and must find a safe path to the goal using the least number of steps.

Reinforcement Learning Approach:
The project applies Q-learning, a popular RL algorithm where the agent learns the optimal policy by maximizing the cumulative reward based on its interactions with the environment. Value Iteration was also explored to enhance the decision-making process of the agent.

Challenges:
The stochastic nature of the environment, where slipping on ice introduces randomness in movements, makes it a challenging problem for the RL agent to solve optimally.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core language for implementing the solution
OpenAI Gym: Environment simulation for the Frozen Lake problem
NumPy: Efficient array manipulations for storing state-action values
Matplotlib: Visualization of learning progress and pathfinding
