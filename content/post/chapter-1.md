### Introduction
This project involves creating a dynamic QR code generator using Python. The aim of this project is to provide users with a tool to generate custom QR codes based on user inputs, such as URLs, text, and contact details. The QR codes can be easily scanned by any QR reader and used in a variety of applications. This project demonstrates expertise in data encoding, image generation, and user interface design using libraries like `qrcode` and `Pillow`. The goal is to deliver a simple yet powerful tool for generating scannable codes in multiple formats.

### Project Preview

**QR Code Generation:**
The project takes input from the user and encodes it into a scannable QR code. It supports inputs such as URLs, text, phone numbers, and contact information. The generated QR codes are outputted as high-quality image files (PNG format).

**Customizability:**
The QR code appearance is customizable, allowing users to change the size, border, color, and error correction level. This ensures that QR codes fit the desired aesthetic and functionality.
